# backend_193026

The backend of the Library app is developed using Spring Boot, which serves as the underlying logic for the application. This code enables users to perform CRUD operations, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting data.

Spring Boot, a framework employed in the backend, facilitates the creation of a scalable, reliable, and secure application. Its robust features, including auto-configuration and dependency injection, allow developers to concentrate on implementing the business logic rather than dealing with infrastructure-related code.

The backend architecture is designed to interact with a database, where information about books, users, reservations, and checkouts is stored and retrieved. RESTful APIs are employed to establish communication with the frontend and provide access to these resources.
